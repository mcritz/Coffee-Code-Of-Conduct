### Reporting Abuse
**If you experience or notice abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let an admin or event host know.**
Unlike online communities, **Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee** events must also account for the physical safety of our community members. For what it’s worth, we have never needed to ask anyone to leave a Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee event as of November 11, 2025.

**Hosts and admins have the responsibility to provide a physically safe environment** including, but not limited to:

- Maintaining a high standard of behavior for ourselves as hosts and admins. We set an example for everyone.
- Be clear and impartial about application of the Code of Conduct. We hold our friends and relations to the same standard as others.
- Choosing safe and healthy venues for events
- Believing people when they report abuse, harassment, or unsafe feelings
- Address concerns with appropriate action taken promptly. Examples:
    - Warn that a given behavior is in violation of this Code of Conduct
    - Informing someone their presence is unwelcome and ask them to leave
    - Barring participation of people who have violated the Code of Conduct in a reasonable manner
    - Inform the venue’s team if someone is behaving in an abusive or unsafe manner
    - Calling the authorities if someone is behaving in an unsafe manner

Warnings are not a requirement for escalating the host and/or admin response. **Any unsafe or abusive behavior will be met with a proportionate response.**

### **Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee** events are a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression 
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion
- employer/employment status

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### As someone who is participating in the community, you agree that:

- We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
- We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
- We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
- We refrain from using language or imagery that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexualizing, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

### We actively work towards:

- Being a safe community.
- Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other.
- Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

### We condemn:

- Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information.
- Threats of harm, harassment.
- Anything that compromises people’s safety.
- Personal attacks.

**These things are NOT OK.**

### Expected Behavior

This community thrives because of everyone's contributions. We exchange ideas, ask questions, answer some of them, have debates, or sometimes are here just to hang out. There are times where the nature of a question may seem simple, has been asked and answered, or may trigger some personal feelings. It may make you feel like a snide or hurtful remark is justified, but it isn't. If you do not have a thoughtful or helpful comment, please refrain from leaving a comment.

Please do not characterize questions others ask as stupid or simple; all questions are welcome. Please do not call out members for the tools they choose to use or decisions they make.

Futile or petty debates about the code of conduct are highly discouraged. This doesn't mean you cannot raise concerns or issues, but please be considerate and constructive, rather than heated and destructive with your commentary.

A simple way to remember how you're expected to act: if you can't find anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

### Digital Content

Please do not post content that is
- Illegal in nature. We do not want to take on the burden of hosting illegal content.
- Nudity. There are plenty of places to find nudity on the internet, this is not one of them.
- More generally [Not Safe For Work](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nsfw).
- Synthetic media (aka deepfakes) without clearly noting it is synthetic media. You may post synthetic media for the purposes of discussion, for example in the context of a debate about how a deepfake is causing problems in our society, not to deceive others into believing it's real.

### If you say or do something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
- Offer a thoughtful apology. ([Here's a good starting point](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-art-of-a-heartfelt-apology-2021041322366) if you need help crafting one. 🙏🏼)

### Infractions

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. 

**For minor infractions, you may:**
- Be temporarily suspended from the participating in events.

**For more serious offenses, repeat offenses, or situations where you are not believed to be acting in good faith, you may:**
- Be asked to leave permanently.
- Have your information and likeness shared with other Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee hosts, admins, and community members as a self defense mechanism to identify troublemakers that seek to disrupt our community.

**For all infractions:**

- Penalties will be determined by the hosts and/or admins. The actions taken will result from a discussion, which you may be a part of, and the consequences will be binding.

#### Online Privacy
- All online conversations are private unless otherwise specified. 
  - The only exceptions to this rule pertain to the enforcement of our code of conduct. A conversation may be shared with any member of the administrative team when a violation of the code of conduct has occurred. The conversation may then be reviewed by the entire administrative team, if necessary, to determine an appropriate resolution.

- If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission from each person involved.

### Best Practices
- Adhere to social norms. Respect people’s boundaries.
    - You must be able to clearly identify when people are using social signals to give them space or be left alone.
    - Your behavior is judged by the hosts’ and/or admins’ standards and they listen to our community. That means it doesn’t matter if you didn’t commit a crime or that you act this way in front of your family, friends, or coworkers.
- Stay on topic. The goal of the Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee is to facilitate discussion of things relating to the host’s group. Be mindful that when hosts form an event around a topic — such as iOS development — the expectation is that people will discuss that topic or anything related to it.
- Communities thrive when everyone contributes in ways beyond promoting themselves or their work. If you are a contributing member of the community, you are welcome to share and promote work you're excited to have done or job opportunities you may have, but this community is not purely a marketing channel. If your only contributions are ones promoting your own work or jobs, we will ask you to stop and may remove any events or groups that are deemed inappropriate.

### Invitations

#### Who to invite
- Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee meetups are meant to be professional events open to the general public. People should feel free to invite others.
- That being said, a good rule of thumb is to invite people you've worked with, collaborated with, or know personally.
